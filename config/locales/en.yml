      cta: The Harder I Practice, the Luckier I Get.
      info_00: Respira is a wearable breathing, heart-rate and speech monitoring device
        to help people who stutter gain fluency.
      info_01: Respira provides real-time feedback on the user’s breathing and speaking
        patterns to reinforce behaviours that can reduce the probability of stuttering.
        Performance history is recorded so the users can track their habits and Improved
        fluency. In addition, anonymous information will be collected on a discretionary
        basis, to enable broader statistical research on stuttering and its causes.
      info_1: Although there are no theories to fully explain the reasons behind chronic
        stuttering, there are many demonstrated psychological and cognitive practices
        that have been shown to help people who stutter (PWS) gain fluency. These
        practices are taught in recognised courses for PWS worldwide, and include
        (but are not limited to) breathing with the diaphragm, limiting the words
        spoken per breath (between 3 and 5), and acceptance of oneself as a PWS. Our
        prototype, Respira, helps PWS to acquire and consolidate all of these habits
        using a single wearable device. Respira conducts physiological measurements
        and performs analysis in real time, allowing it to gently coach the user to
        develop positive habits.
      info_2: With the rise of the IoT and wearable technologies, we are not only
        able to reshape breathing and speaking habits, but can also record and analyse
        the physiological data and speaking tempo of PWS. This provides valuable real-time
        information for the user to improve their fluency and the scope for fundamental
        health science (in order to understand and control the mechanisms of chronic
        stuttering).
      info_3: Respira is the first hardware product of its kind. Its main innovation
        resides in integrating the latest research on stuttering into an affordable
        device.
      info_4: Speaking at the right speed and breathing correctly are practices that
        have to be reinforced at all times until they become habits. Unfortunately,
        this requires considerable discipline since people who stutter learn to speak
        through many years of bad practice. Real-time feedback is critical in order
        to acquire new breathing and pausing habits.
      info_5: People who stutter do not always stutter. As a result, they only tend
        to use new techniques in difficult speaking situations, outside of their comfort
        zone. However, these techniques are ineffective if only used when fear is
        high. This is precisely why it is important to always wear the Device, even
        in situations that are not critical.
      info_6: Our goal is to help people who stutter gain fluency and provide data
        to enable systematic research on stuttering.

    features:

      feature_1: Comfortable belt around the chest that tracks "your" own particular
        breathing and speaking habits during the day, as well as other physiological
        indicators (heart rate + voice pitch).
      feature_2: The belt vibrates whenever users do not use their full diaphragm
        to breathe or speak too fast during the day, so new correct habits are built.
      feature_3: Record performance history and set targets to make your learning
        experience more gentle or insistent.
      feature_hidden_1: Respira is a virtual coach that is with you 24/7
      feature_hidden_2: We ensure that you use appropriate pausing and have enough
        air in your lungs.
      feature_hidden_3: Your optimum breathing rate should be less than 7 breaths
        per minute in relaxation
      features_moto: Pause, Breathe, Speak, Repeat.

      why_2_html: More than 70 million people stutter worldwide, this is about 1% of the population. Our mission is to help these people to live a better life.<br><br> Most people who stutter (PWS) live in chronic fear and anxiety, as they do not know when a word or utterance will block their speech. The inability of PWS to express themselves leads to feelings of shame and despair, as they feel that their capacity to communicate eloquently and articulately is impaired. These feelings significantly affect the life choices and opportunities of PWS, who usually seek out roles and activities with a limited amount of face-to-face interaction. This has a profound impact on their professional and social life, as the fear of stuttering dictates their life choices.<br><br>
        Most of us take for granted the ability to use the telephone, to ask for what we need when shopping, or to answer questions at a job interview. But people who stammer frequently struggle to make themselves understood by those who do not recognise the difficulties and frustrations of stammering. <br><br> 
        Speech and language therapists help PWS to gain fluency and reach articulation levels similar to that of a non-stutterer by the use of a series of techniques. We have developed a wearable device that tracks speech and breathing patterns, providing real-time feedback to help turn those techniques into habits.<br><br>

    welcome:
      hello: Hello
      p1: Thank you for registering with Respira!
      p2: We would appreciate it if you could share information about our project.
      p3: Respira is a wearable breathing, heart-rate and speech monitoring device
        to help people who stutter gain fluency.
      p4: It is hard for fluent speakers to truly understand what a person who stutters
        goes through every time they have to speak. That's why we created Respira,
        to help people gain confidence, fluency and live a better life.
      p5: More than 70 million (adult) people stutter worldwide, which is about 1%
        of the population. Our mission is to help this 1% live a better life.
      p6: Please feel free to email us any queries or questions. We would also like
        to hear from people interested in getting involved in the project (whatever
        your background) and/or willing to try out our first prototypes.
      p7: Many thanks for joining us!
      p8: The Respira Team.
